Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my Wonde Assessment application. 

Instructions:

1) Download WondeAssessment.html and WondeAssessment.js and keep them in the same directory

2) Open the WondeAssessment.html via a web browser to run the application

3) Alternatively open both files in a code editor to view all code.

Notes:

I have used the employee id attribute of the employee object to filter for results, however
this can be changed to a more suitable attribute if necessary as in practise teachers may 
not know this.

For displayed attributes I used full names of teachers and students which can be ammended in
future to add other attributes necessary for the user's search.

Some employee id's I have tested to get class results include:

Employee Id: A1851705507
Employee Id: A1248519453
Employee Id: A1182443529
Employee Id: A176257021
Employee Id: A1907430539
Employee Id: A2123581366
